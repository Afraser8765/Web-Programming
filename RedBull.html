<p id="text1">Red Bull were no strangers to F1 - as sponsors - prior to formally entering as<br>
a works team in 2004.Nonetheless, the scale of their success over the following <br>
decade was staggering. After a first podium in 2006, the team hit their stride<br>
in 2009, claiming six victories and second in the constructors' standings. Over <br>
the next four seasons they were a tour de force, claiming consecutive title <br>
doubles between 2010 and 2013, with Sebastian Vettel emerging as the sport's <br>
youngest quadruple champion.<br>
