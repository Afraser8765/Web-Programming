<p id="text1">For many, Ferrari and Formula 1 racing have become inseparable. <br>
The only team to have competed in every season since the world championship <br>
began, the PrancingHorse has grown from the humble dream of founder Enzo <br>
Ferrari to become one of the most iconic and recognised brands in the world.<br>
Success came quickly through the likes of Alberto Ascari and John Surtees,<br>

then Michael Schumacher in the 2000s, when Ferrari claimed a then <br>
unprecedented five consecutive title doubles
